= MuckShares

Add sharing functionality to your muck application.

== Setup
Install the gem:
  sudo gem install muck-shares
This should also install other required muck gems.  Items are shared into the user's activity feed as well as the 
dashboard activity feed of any users that following or friends with the current user.

== Usage

=== Share model
Create a model called share in your project and add the following:
  
  class Share < ActiveRecord::Base
    acts_as_muck_share
  end
This let's you add any other methods to the share model that you see fit.

=== User model
You will need a user model that will do the sharing:
  class User < ActiveRecord::Base
    acts_as_muck_sharer
  end

MuckShares will look for 'current_user' when adding new shares.
